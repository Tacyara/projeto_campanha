This project analyzes data by segment, and brings up some measures and 
correlations that can help the decision maker on which paths to follow.
It will be possible to: analyze wine consumption by gender in the last 2 years;
meat consumption by income in the last 2 years and at what stage of the marketing 
campaign are offers in general most accepted by the clients.
